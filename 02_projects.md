Experimental characterization of animal behavior is often limited by the presence of artificial boundaries which act as confounding inputs to the animal's decision algorithm. By designing and building a portable camera array, I hope to enable the multidimensional tracking of naturalistic odor plume navigation in *Drosophila*.

Behavior can be understood as a set of control laws describing an animal's interactions with its environment—conditional on its discrete internal state—and a set of rules for switching between those states. I am using formal methods from the hybrid systems theory that underlies this architecture to generate hypotheses which guide the design of experiments related to odor plume navigation in *Drosophila*.

When collecting neural data, researchers often need a rigorous method for assigning corresponences between neurons across imaging modalities. By combining point-cloud and pixel-based registration techniques, I developed a new method which is robust to many common artifacts which challenge even human classification.
