# About Me
My name is Kellan Moorse. I am a PhD student in Michael Dickinson's lab at Caltech, and I am interested in combining mathematical modeling and experimental methods to examine neurobiological systems at the behavioral level. In particular, I am applying methods from stochastic processes and control theory to better understand the highly robust and efficient odor plume navigation behavior exhibited by the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster*.
