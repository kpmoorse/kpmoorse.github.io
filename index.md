# About Me

My name is Kellan Moorse. I am a first-year PhD student in the Computation and Neural Systems option at Caltech, and I am interested in developing mathematical models to explain and predict the dynamics of neurobiological systems. In particular, I am applying control theoretic principles to better understand the highly robust and efficient behavior exhibited by the fruit fly *drosophila melanogaster*.
